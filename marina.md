# Freelance Web Development

### Background
The Des Moines Marina Association (DMMA) is a non-profit organization serving marina moorage tenants and anyone interested in 
improving the Des Moines Marina, which is located in Des Moines, WA. The DMMA works to preserve the health and welfare of the 
Des Moines Marina, and to promote the value of the marina to city residents. The marina association was created to support 
and promote the marina tenants and related boating activities at the Des Moines Marina. Over the years, this support 
and promotion has been expanded to include non-tenants who are interested in improving the Marina.

### Project description
This project's goal was to update and redesign the DMMA's website, so that they can more effectively reach people in their 
community. I was contracted to update the site in Summer 2022. The project included meetings with the DMMA board on progress, 
as well as to ask clarifying questions. 

Summary of features added:
* Seamless membership database management
* Dynamic calendar display and editing functionality
* Hosting of short videos and YouTube video linking
* Streamlined electronic member dues payment processing
* Efficient email communication with members in bulk
* Document archiving capabilities
* Convenient and straightforward member survey tools

### Outcomes
The DMMA board was happy with their site, and I was later contracted by somebody on the DMMA board for another, smaller, 
project to update another Des Moines Marina-related site - [link](https://www.desmoinesmarinawatch.com/). Through this project,
I gained skills in web design, communication with clients, and project management.
